			Terms of Service
			Castle Protection, Inc. 
		</h2>
		<p>
			Customer may cancel this Agreement by returning the Equipment within seven (7) days of the initial delivery date to Customer. The return package must be postmarked within 7 days of the original delivery date and returned postage paid to <%= APP['app_name'] %>, 820 Kastrin, El Paso, TX 79907. This Agreement will not be cancelled until the returned equipment is received at <%= APP['app_name'] %>. Customer shall be required to provide proof of delivery if requested. A $80.00 restocking fee, debited from Customer's account submitted as part of this Agreement, shall be assessed on all returns. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Fees and Electronic Funds Transfer Payment. Customer agrees to maintain an automatic bank debit payment or credit card payment arrangement with <%= APP['app_name'] %> for the entire term of the Agreement, including renewals. Customer authorizes <%= APP['app_name'] %> or its assignees to initiate debit entries monthly from Customer's depository account or credit card for current and any past due amounts. If <%= APP['app_name'] %> erroneously debits funds from Customer's approved account, Customer authorizes <%= APP['app_name'] %> or its assignees and successors to initiate necessary credit entries to rectify error. A late payment charge from the due date at a rate of one and one-half percent (1-1/2%) per month (18% per year) of the unpaid balance or any lesser rate if required by law will be charged on any part of service fees unpaid for 10 days after it is due. Customer is liable for Monthly Service Fees whether Equipment is on line or not on line with the Monitoring Facility, as the Equipment provides value when not monitored. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Monitoring Service. Monitoring will be provided by <%= APP['app_name'] %>'s Monitoring Facility (the "Monitoring Facility"). When an alarm signal from the Equipment is received, the Monitoring Facility will attempt to telephone the proper law enforcement authorities or other emergency agency that Customer provided to <%= APP['app_name'] %>, as permitted by law, plus an Emergency Contact provided by Customer to <%= APP['app_name'] %>. To avoid false alarms, the Monitoring Facility may contact Customer's premises first to determine if an actual emergency exists before calling any emergency agency. If the Monitoring Facility has reason to believe that no actual emergency exists, it may choose not to place such notification calls. Additionally, if the proper user code is entered in the Equipment within sixty (60) seconds of alarm activation, an abort code will be sent to the Monitoring Facility. In such instance, the Monitoring Facility may, but is not required to, notify Customer's premise, any emergency agency or Emergency Contact. <%= APP['app_name'] %> may modify or discontinue any particular response service or notification procedures due to governmental or insurance requirements.
		</p>
		<p>
			<%= APP['app_name'] %> may also collect information about you that is not personally-identifiable. Examples of this type of information may include your age, gender, interests and preferences and the type of Internet browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, and the domain name of the Web site from which you linked to the Web site. <%= APP['app_name'] %> may share this information with advertisers, business partners, sponsors or other third parties. For example, <%= APP['app_name'] %> may inform a sponsor that the users of the Web site is x percent females and y percent males. This data is used to customize the Web site's content and advertising, and will deliver a better experience to our users.
		</p>
		<p>
			Customer acknowledges and agrees that both Customer and <%= APP['app_name'] %> are required to comply with all laws, rules and regulations regarding monitoring and alarm response enacted or adopted by the governmental authorities having jurisdiction over Customer's premises. If such governmental agencies, now or in the future requires physical or visual verification or multi-telephone verification (e.g. two-call verification) of an emergency condition before responding to a request for assistance, <%= APP['app_name'] %> may, without notice, modify its monitoring procedures to comply with such requirements, and Customer may be required to pay an additional monthly fee in addition to the current monthly fee.
		</p>
		<p>
			SOME MUNICIPALITIES REQUIRE AN ALARM PERMIT AND MAY NOT DISPATCH EMERGENCY PERSONNEL IF THE PROPER PERMIT(S) IS NOT OBTAINED. SOME MAY REQUIRE THE PERMIT TO BE ON FILE BEFORE DISPATCHING EMERGENCY PERSONNEL. SOME JURISDICTIONS REQUIRE THAT THE ALARM PERMIT BE OBTAINED PRIOR TO THE INSTALLATION AND ACTIVATION OF THE EQUIPMENT. CUSTOMER IS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY PERMIT(S) FROM THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. IT IS CUSTOMER'S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY, TO OBTAIN, PAY FOR, AND MAINTAIN ALL NECESSARY PERMIT(S). Customer understands and agrees Customer shall be responsible for the acquiring and renewing all applicable licenses and permits as required by any and all governmental entities, as currently in force and maybe amended hereafter, in connection with the system and services. IF CUSTOMER FAILS TO MAINTAIN ANY REQUIRED LICENSES OR PERMIT(S), <%= (APP['app_name']).upcase %> WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR PERFORMING THE SERVICES AND MAY TERMINATE THE SERVICES WITHOUT NOTICE TO CUSTOMER. CUSTOMER ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY, AND WILL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, PAY AND HOLD HARMLESS <%= (APP['app_name']).upcase %>, FOR ANY AND ALL FINES AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH USING THE SYSTEM WITHOUT THE PROPER PERMITS AND LICENSES. Upon commencement of monitoring, <%= APP['app_name'] %> will thoroughly instruct Customer in the proper use of the Equipment.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some municipalities require a third party, other than the law enforcement agency, to respond to alarm activations. <%= APP['app_name'] %> does not provide third-party alarm response service, unless a Rider is entered into in writing by Customer and <%= APP['app_name'] %>. It is the responsibility of Customer to obtain third party response where required and pay for any costs associated with third party services. Customer will provide in writing the third party emergency contact information to Monitoring Facility and <%= APP['app_name'] %>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Limited Warranty. Equipment provided by PAI has a Limited Warranty. <%= APP['app_name'] %> warrants to Customer that Equipment is suitable for originating signals to the Monitoring Facility and will be free of defects in materials and workmanship. <%= APP['app_name'] %> will ship new or re-manufactured replacement parts for all defective security Equipment to Customer, at no charge for replacement parts. This warranty period will remain in effect for at least ninety (90) days or as long as Customer complies with the terms of this Agreement and the Equipment is monitored by <%= APP['app_name'] %>, whichever is longer. It is the responsibility of Customer to notify <%= APP['app_name'] %> of any defective part within ten (10) days of the malfunction and to return any defective part to <%= APP['app_name'] %>. This Warranty does not cover damages as a result of any defect in or failure of Equipment due to any event or condition beyond <%= APP['app_name'] %> control, such as misuse, negligence, accident, theft or unexplained loss, fire, winds, acts of God, breakdown or communications controlled or regulated by any third party, failure on Customer's part to test Equipment monthly, any alarm system equipment not provided by <%= APP['app_name'] %>, any unauthorized repair or tampering, or in the event product is not used for its intended purposes. Equipment is designed to operate with the Monitoring Facility and may not work with other companies' services. Customer Assistance will be provided to Customer only if all monthly service and all other fees are current. <%= APP['app_name'] %> DOES NOT WARRANT THE FOLLOWING (1) THAT THE EQUIPMENT OR THE SERVICE WILL NOT BE DISABLED, COMPROMISED OR CIRCUMVENTED; (2) THAT THE EQUIPMENT OR SERVICE WILL PREVENT ANY LOSS OF PROPERTY OR PERSONAL INJURY BY BURGLARY, HOLD-UP, FIRE, MEDICAL PROBLEM OR OTHERWISE; AND/OR (3) THAT THE EQUIPMENT AND SERVICE WILL IN ALL CASES PROVIDE THE DETECTION FOR WHICH IT IS INSTALLED. <%= (APP['app_name']).upcase %>'S SOLE OBLIGATION, AND CUSTOMER'S SOLE REMEDY UNDER THE WARRANTY, IS REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF THE EQUIPMENT AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION. Customer agrees to test the Equipment monthly, in accordance with the instructions that Customer hereby acknowledges Customer has received from <%= APP['app_name'] %>, to ensure the system is functioning properly, the system is properly monitored, and is required for all Customer rights and remedies under this Agreement to remain in effect. Some states do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of consequential or incidental damages or a limitation on the duration of implied warranties, so the above limitation or exclusions may not apply. The warranty gives specific legal rights and there may be other rights that vary from state to state.
		</p>
		<p>
			Assignees / Contractors. <%= APP['app_name'] %> shall have the right to assign this Agreement to any other person, firm, corporation or entity without notice to Customer and shall have the further right to subcontract any monitoring service or other services which it may perform. Customer acknowledges this Agreement, and particularly those paragraphs relating to <%= APP['app_name'] %>'s maximum liability, third party indemnification and warranty limitations, inure to the benefit of and are applicable to any assignees or subcontractors (including Monitoring Facility and Collection Agency) with the same force and effect as they bind Customer to <%= APP['app_name'] %>. Customer may not assign Customer's rights under this Agreement without <%= APP['app_name'] %>'s written consent.
		</p>
		<p>
			Limitation of Liability. CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS THAT <%= (APP['app_name']).upcase %> IS NOT AN INSURER OF THE SAFETY OF CUSTOMER OR ANY PROPERTY. CUSTOMER AGREES TO OBTAIN, AT CUSTOMER'S SOLE COST AND EXPENSE, ANY INSURANCE COVERAGE CUSTOMER DESIRES TO HAVE TO INSURE AGAINST PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY LOSS OR DAMAGES AT THE PREMISES WHERE THE EQUIPMENT IS LOCATED. <%= APP['app_name'] %> SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE, RISK, INJURY, DEATH OR EFFECTS OF ANY HAZARD OR EVENT, PROPERTY LOSS OR DAMAGE DUE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO ANY FAILURE TO DETECT OR AVERT AN OCCURRENCE OF AN EVENT THAT THE SERVICE IS DESIGNED TO DETECT OR AVERT.
		</p>
		<p>
			IN NO EVENT OR FAILURE THEREOF SHALL <%= (APP['app_name']).upcase %> BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, HOWSOEVER CAUSED, AS A RESULT OF THE DESIGN OR OPERATION OF THE EQUIPMENT OR FAILURE THEREOF OR NEGLIGENCE OF <%= (APP['app_name']).upcase %>'S MONITORING FACILITY, <%= (APP['app_name']).upcase %>'S AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES. THESE LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY TO ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM ANY CLAIMS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CLAIMS IN CONTRACT, TORT, (INCLUDING GROSS NEGLIGENCE) AND STRICT LIABILITY EVEN IF <%= (APP['app_name']).upcase %> HAS BEEN ADVISED OF SUCH DAMAGES OR POTENTIAL THEREOF AND CUSTOMER AGREES TO AND SHALL RELEASE, INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, AND HOLD HARMLESS <%= (APP['app_name']).upcase %>, ITS EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS FOR AND AGAINST ALL SUCH CLAIMS, LAWSUITS AND LOSSES.
		</p>
		<p>
			CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS IMPRACTICAL AND EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO AFFIX THE ACTUAL DAMAGES, IF ANY, WHICH MAY PROXIMATELY RESULT FROM <%= (APP['app_name']).upcase %>'S NEGLIGENCE OR FAILURE TO PERFORM ANY OF THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE FAILURE OF THE EQUIPMENT OR SERVICE TO PROPERLY OPERATE. SHOULD THERE ARISE ANY LIABILITY OF <%= (APP['app_name']).upcase %>, IRRESPECTIVE OF CAUSE OR ORIGIN, CUSTOMER AGREES THAT <%= (APP['app_name']).upcase %>'S LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER AND ALL OTHER PERSONS IS LIMITED TO AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO AND NOT EXCEED THIRTY-SIX MONTHS OF THE MONTHLY SERVICE FEE SPECIFIED ON THIS AGREEMENT. CUSTOMER FURTHER AGREES THAT THE AMOUNT STATED IN THIS SECTION IS REASONABLE AND SHALL BE CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.
		</p>
		<p>
			SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY.
		</p>
		<p>
			IF CUSTOMER WISHES PAI TO ASSUME A HIGHER LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AS SET FORTH ABOVE, CUSTOMER MAY OBTAIN FROM <%= (APP['app_name']).upcase %> A HIGHER LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVISION BY PAYING AN ADDITIONAL MONTHLY SERVICE FEE TO <%= (APP['app_name']).upcase %> AS MAY BE AGREED UPON BY <%= (APP['app_name']).upcase %> AND CUSTOMER. IF CUSTOMER ELECTS TO EXERCISE THIS OPTION, A RIDER SHALL BE ENTERED INTO IN WRITING BY CUSTOMER AND <%= APP['app_name'] %> SETTING FORTH THE TERMS, CONDITIONS AND THE AMOUNT OF THE HIGHER LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, AND THE ADDITIONAL MONTHLY CHARGE. SUCH RIDER AND ADDITIONAL OBLIGATION SHALL IN NO WAY BE INTERPRETED TO MAKE PAI AN INSURER.
		</p>
		<p>
			Limitations on Actions, Waiver of Jury Trial. Arbitration. Please read this paragraph carefully, as it affects important legal rights, including rights you otherwise may have in court. <%= (APP['app_name']).upcase %> AND CUSTOMER AGREE TO ARBITRATE ANY AND ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CLAIMS BASED ON OR ARISING FROM ANY ALLEGED TORT, OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO AGREEMENT EXCEPT FOR THE COLLECTION OF MONIES OWED BY CUSTOMER TO PAI UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.
		</p>
		<p>
			Arbitration of any dispute or claim EXCEPT for collection of past due accounts shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). The AAA rules and fee information are available from the AAA upon request. CUSTOMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PAYMENT OF ALL OF CUSTOMER'S COSTS AND EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE ARBITRATION, INCLUDING THE FILING FEE AND CUSTOMER'S COST OF TRAVELLING TO THE ARBITRATION SITE. UNLESS CUSTOMER AND PAI AGREE OTHERWISE IN WRITING, THE LOCATION OF THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE IN EL PASO, El Paso COUNTY, TEXAS.
		</p>
		<p>
			Except where prohibited by law, <%= APP['app_name'] %> and Customer agree that no arbitrator has authority to (1) award relief in excess of what Agreement provides, (2) award punitive damages or any other damages not measured by prevailing party's actual damages, (3) commit errors of law or legal reasoning, or (4) order consolidation or class arbitration. The Arbitrator must give effect to the limitations on <%= APP['app_name'] %>'s liability as set forth in this Agreement. Customer agrees that Customer and <%= APP['app_name'] %> are each waiving their respective rights of a trail by jury and Customer acknowledges that arbitration is final and binding and subject only to very limited review by a court. This arbitration provision does not apply to the collection of past due amounts owed by Customer to <%= APP['app_name'] %>. Both parties hereby agree that no suit or action that relates in any way to this Agreement (whether based upon contract, negligence or otherwise) shall be brought against the other more than two (2) years after the accrual of the cause of action therefrom. In addition, if arbitration is not available, both parties hereby waive any rights to a jury trial in any judicial action by either party which relates in any way to this Agreement, whether based upon contract, negligence or otherwise.
		</p>

CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS THAT PAI OR MONITORING FACILITY WILL NOT SEND <%= (APP['app_name']).upcase %> OR MONITORING FACILITY PERSONNEL TO CUSTOMER'S LOCATION IN RESPONSE TO ANY ALARM SIGNAL RECEIVED. CUSTOMER ALSO UNDERSTANDS THAT <%= (APP['app_name']).upcase %> OR MONITORING FACILITY DO NOT REPRESENT OR PROMISE THAT ANYONE TELEPHONED WILL RESPOND TO THE CALL, AND CUSTOMER RELEASES <%= (APP['app_name']).upcase %> AND MONITORING FACILITY FROM ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY FAILURE OR DELAY IN RESPONDING. <%= (APP['app_name']).upcase %> WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE IN THE EVENT THEY ARE UNABLE TO NOTIFY EMERGENCY CONTACTS PROVIDED BY CUSTOMER.
		</p>
		<p>
			Customer will indemnify, defend and hold harmless <%= APP['app_name'] %> from and against any responsibility or liability for payment of any fine, penalties or other charges for any false alarms or signals. If <%= APP['app_name'] %> reasonably determines that the Equipment is generating an excessive number of false alarms or signals, <%= APP['app_name'] %> may, after notice to Customer, require Customer to pay a surcharge fee if the false alarms or signals continue after such notice. If the false alarms or signals continue after such notice and imposition of a surcharge fee, <%= APP['app_name'] %> may terminate this Agreement after ten (10) days written notice to Customer. Customer authorizes <%= APP['app_name'] %> to temporarily disconnect the monitoring service for nuisance or safety reasons if <%= APP['app_name'] %> is unable to notify Customer or Customer's Emergency Contacts at the numbers submitted to <%= APP['app_name'] %> by Customer or if Customer or Customer's Emergency Contacts refuse or fail to arrive at Customer's location within a reasonable amount of time. ALL FINES, PENALTIES OR CHARGES FOR FALSE ALARMS OR SIGNALS SHALL BE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF CUSTOMER TO PAY.
		</p>
		<p>
			Default / Termination. If Customer is in default of this Agreement for failure to pay any fees, charges or other amounts when due, or failure to perform any of the other Customer Obligations under this Agreement, and such default continues for ten (10) days after <%= APP['app_name'] %> gives Customer written notice, in addition to any other remedies provided by law, <%= APP['app_name'] %> may, by notice to Customer, without releasing Customer for payment of all the Monthly Monitoring Fees and any additional charges as contemplated by this Agreement, declare immediately due and payable an amount equal to all Monthly Monitoring Fees and other fees to be paid by Customer during the remaining term (initial or renewal) of this Agreement. If <%= APP['app_name'] %>'s records indicate that Customer is past due or in default, <%= APP['app_name'] %> is authorized to seek collection of the past due account. Customer agrees to waive the applicable provisions of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act by allowing and requesting <%= APP['app_name'] %> to contact Customer for the purposes of collecting a debt. <%= APP['app_name'] %> may transfer any past due account to an independent third party collection agency for the purpose of collecting a debt. Customer will be responsible for paying the remaining applicable balance owed under the Agreement as well as all fees assessed by the collection agency. Customer acknowledges that any attempts to collect a debt by a third party collection agency are not to be attributed to <%= APP['app_name'] %>.
			</p>
			<p>
				If Customer defaults with respect to payment of Monthly Monitoring Fees more than two (2) times in any calendar year, or monthly monitoring fee becomes sixty (60) days past due, then Customer agrees that <%= APP['app_name'] %> may terminate service and the remaining applicable balance of the Agreement will be immediately due and payable. <%= APP['app_name'] %> may draft Customer's account for the entire remaining balance, disconnect monitoring with prior notice or require Customer to pay yearly in advance for services. In addition, Customer agrees <%= APP['app_name'] %> will have no liability if disconnection occurs due to a past due balance or otherwise.
			</p>
			<p>
				<%= APP['app_name'] %> may suspend or cancel this Agreement, without notice and without liability or penalty in the event the Monitoring Facility, the communications facilities connecting Customer's location to the Monitoring Facility, or other equipment are destroyed by fire, catastrophe or by any other means, or are so substantially damaged that it is impractical to continue service; or in the event that <%= APP['app_name'] %> is unable to either secure or retain the connections or privileges necessary for the transmission of signals between Customer's location and the Monitoring Facility and the law enforcement agency or other emergency contacts for any reason or cause whatsoever. <%= APP['app_name'] %> assumes no liability for the interruption of the service due to any cause and <%= APP['app_name'] %> will not be required to supply the Service to Customer while interruption of the Service for any cause continues and Customer is not entitled to any refund or credit of any charges for such interruption of service.
			</p>
			<p>
				Installation Requirements and Customer Duties. Customer shall provide a hard-wired, single party phone line and phone jack, or broadband communicator, as applicable, and electrical outlet within five (5) feet of the location of the Command Station. Customer will follow all of <%= APP['app_name'] %>'s instructions regarding installation, maintenance, testing and use of the Equipment, and Customer will not allow or permit alteration of the Equipment except in a manner approved in writing by <%= APP['app_name'] %>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Customer agrees to pay all sales, use, property, service or other taxes in connection with Service including installation and monitoring of Equipment and sales of any additional equipment; all charges made by any telephone company, broadband service provider or other utility installation, leasing or service of the telephone network or broadband service, as applicable, connecting Customer location to the Monitoring Facility; any increase in electricity charges; or any building permit or other fees required under any ordinances or laws in order to install Equipment in Customer location.
			</p>
			<p>
				Equipment is the property of Customer. The Equipment will be delivered to the address submitted by Customer and installed following the installation procedure approved by <%= APP['app_name'] %>. Risk of loss of the Equipment, or any part of the same, shall pass to Customer upon delivery to Customer's premises of the Equipment or part thereof.
			</p>
			<p>
				IF CUSTOMER FAILS TO TEST THE SYSTEM ON A MONTHLY BASIS, <%= (APP['app_name']).upcase %> WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY WARRANTIES OR SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.
			</p>
			<p>
				Rapid Activation. Customer acknowledges that the Standard System Activation Charge of $295.00 has been waived in exchange for Customer's agreement to install and activate the Equipment, in accordance with the standard installation procedures included with the Equipment, within twenty (20) days of receiving the Equipment. In the event Customer fails to install and activate the Equipment within twenty (20) days of receipt of the Equipment, Customer authorizes <%= APP['app_name'] %> or its assignee to charge the Standard System Activation Charge of $295.00 to Customer's credit card or bank account, as provided.
			</p>
			<p>
				Connection Fee. <%= APP['app_name'] %>, at its sole option, may require Customer to pay a one-time non-refundable connection fee which will be included with the cost of the Equipment package that Customer selects for purchase.
			</p>
			<p>
				Phone Lines. The Equipment includes a communicator that sends signals to the Monitoring Facility over Customer's telephone or broadband service, as applicable. Customer acknowledges that signals are transmitted over the telephone company's or, broadband service provider's networks and are beyond the control of <%= APP['app_name'] %> and the Monitoring Facility. Customer acknowledges that if the phone or broadband service is disconnected in any manner whatsoever, or not working for any reason, alarm signals cannot be transmitted to the Monitoring Facility. If the telephone or broadband service is out of order, placed on vacation status or otherwise not working, signals cannot be transmitted and <%= APP['app_name'] %> will not know of the telephone or broadband service problem. Customer agrees to reimburse <%= APP['app_name'] %> for any cost incurred by <%= APP['app_name'] %> to reprogram the communications device of the Equipment because of area code changes, other dialing pattern changes or other communication access changes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Customer will pay for all telephone or broadband service charges including any installation fee for any special jack or other device to connect the system to Customer's telephone or broadband service. When the alarm is activated, Customer may be unable to use the telephone or broadband service to make other calls (such as calls to the 911 emergency operator). If the service is discontinued or Customer moves, it becomes the responsibility of Customer to call <%= APP['app_name'] %> so the communicator may be disabled from sending signals.
			</p>
			<p>
				TAMPERING WITH OR DISRUPTION OF TELEPHONE OR BROADBAND SERVICE OR CUTTING OF PHONE OR BROADBAND SERVICE LINES WILL PREVENT THE TRANSMISSION OF THE SIGNAL. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT MAY BE AVAILABLE AT AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE TO MONITOR THIS CONDITION OR PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATION CHANNEL AS A BACKUP.
			</p>
			<p>
				The use of DSL, VoIP or other broadband telephone service may prevent the system from transmitting alarm signals to the Monitoring Facility at time of Equipment installation or any time in the future. It is the responsibility of Customer to have their telephone service provider to install the necessary transmission filters to allow transmission of alarms signals. Customer agrees to notify <%= APP['app_name'] %> if DSL, VoIP or other broadband telephone service has been installed or if Customer intends to install DSL, VoIP or other broadband telephone service. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE INSTALLATION OF ANY BROADBAND TELEPHONE SERVICE CUSTOMER MUST TEST THE SYSTEM'S SIGNAL TRANSMISSION. Additionally, <%= APP['app_name'] %> recommends Customer install and maintain appropriate battery backup to the broadband service router, switch and modem providing Internet access to help ensure uninterrupted communication access in case of power loss to Customer premises. It is the sole responsibility of the Customer to provide adequate power back-up to the DSL, VoIP, or broadband communication equipment when used with the security system Equipment to help ensure uninterrupted communication access in case of power loss to Customer's premises. Customer acknowledges that failure to provide adequate power back-up during a power outage will disable communications to the monitoring station and alarm signals will not be send and, as a result, Customer's Emergency Contacts will not be notified. The Equipment cannot transmit signals to the Monitoring Facility via Customer's cellular phone service. Customer understands that additional equipment may be available, at an additional cost and additional monthly fee that may transmit signals.
			</p>
			<p>
				Customer agrees that Customer negotiated and executed this Agreement solely by means of facsimile, mail, telephone and/or Internet communications. Customer agrees to the terms of this Agreement, including the Electronics Fund Transfer requirement, which together supersede any and all other agreements, understandings, representations, oral or written, and no other agreements exist, written or oral.
			</p>
			<p>
				The initial term of this Agreement shall be 3 years, commencing on the date product is delivered to Customer. AGREEMENT WILL AUTOMATICALLY CONTINUE FOR SUCCESSIVE ONE-YEAR RENEWAL TERMS, AS ALLOWED BY LAW, UNLESS <%= APP['app_name'] %> RECEIVES A WRITTEN NOTICE OF CANCELLATION FROM CUSTOMER VIA U.S. MAIL OR OVERNIGHT MAIL POSTMARKED AT LEAST THIRTY (30) DAYS BUT NO EARLIER THAN NINETY (90) DAYS PRIOR TO THE END OF THE INITIAL TERM OR ANY SUBSEQUENT RENEWAL TERM. CUSTOMER MAY BE REQUIRED TO SHOW PROOF OF DELIVERY. IF ONE-YEAR RENEWALS ARE BARRED BY LAW IN ANY JURSIDCTION, THIS AGREEMENT SHALL RENEW ON A MONTH-TO-MONTH BASIS IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS.
			</p>
			<p>
				(We) authorized <%= APP['app_name'] %> to request and obtain credit history from a credit bureau or other agency providing credit information, and said credit bureau or other agency has my permission to release this credit information to <%= APP['app_name'] %>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Notices and Legal Matters. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of Texas. <%= APP['app_name'] %> is not bound by any change or waiver of any provision of the foregoing unless such change or waiver is signed by an authorized officer of <%= APP['app_name'] %>.
