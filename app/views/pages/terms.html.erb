Communication software is part of the instrument panel programmed to transmit a signal and shall remain CASTLE's property. Passcode to CPU software remains property of CASTLE.

		<p>
      <span class="terms_bullet">3.</span> INSTALLATION AND SERVICE CHARGES: Subscriber agrees to pay CASTLE:

The balance of payments for the term of this agreement is due upon execution of this agreement. For the convenience of the parties and so long as there is no default in payments, Subscriber may make the payments as provided herein. The amount of the monthly monitoring charge reflects the equipment selected by the Buyer in CASTLE’s Sales Contract and delivered by CASTLE to Buyer pursuant to that Sales Contract.
		</p>
		<p>
      <span class="terms_sub_bullet">(c)</span>  <span class="bold">Subscriber Agrees to have its credit card automatically charged for all charges under this contract.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
      <span class="terms_bullet">4.</span> TERM OF AGREEMENT: RENEWAL INCREASE: The term of this agreement shall be for a period of four years and shall automatically renew month to month thereafter under the same terms and conditions, unless either party gives written notice to the other by certified mail, return receipt requested, of their intention not to renew the contract at least 30 days prior to the expiration of any term. CASTLE shall be permitted from time to time to increase the monitoring charge by an amount not to exceed nine percent each year after the initial four
      year agreement and Subscriber agrees to pay such increase as invoiced.
		</p>
		<p>
      <span class="terms_bullet">5.</span> CENTRAL OFFICE MONITORING: Upon receipt of a signal from Subscriber’s alarm system, CASTLE’s, or its designee
      communication center, shall make every reasonable effort to notify Subscriber and the appropriate municipal police or fire department. Subscriber acknowledges that signals transmitted from Subscriber's premises directly to municipal police or fire departments are not monitored by personnel of CASTLE or CASTLE's designee communication center and CASTLE does not assume any responsibility for the manner in which such signals are monitored or the response, if any, to such signals. Subscriber acknowledges that signals which are transmitted over telephone lines, wire, air waves, internet, VOIP, or other modes of communication pass through communication networks wholly beyond the control of CASTLE and are not maintained by CASTLE and, therefore, CASTLE shall not be responsible for any failure which prevents transmission signals from reaching the central office monitoring center or damages arising therefrom, or for data corruption, theft or viruses to subscriber’s computers if connected to the alarm communication equipment. Subscriber agrees to furnish CASTLE with a written list of names and telephone numbers of those persons Subscriber wishes to receive notification of alarm signals. All changes and revisions shall be supplied to CASTLE in writing. Subscriber authorizes CASTLE to access the control panel to input or delete data and programming. If the equipment contains listening devices permitting central office to monitor sound then upon receipt of an alarm signal central office shall monitor sound for so long as central office in its sole discretion deems appropriate to confirm an alarm condition. If Subscriber requests CASTLE to remotely activate or deactivate the system, change combinations, openings or closings, or re-program system functions, Subscriber shall pay CASTLE $25.00 for each such service. CASTLE may, without prior notice, suspend or terminate its services, in central station’s sole discretion, in event of Subscriber’s default in performance of this agreement or in event central station facility or communication network is non-operational or subscriber’s alarm system is sending excessive false alarms. Central station is authorized to record and maintain audio and video transmissions, data and communications, and shall be the exclusive owner of such property.
		</p>
		<p>
      <span class="terms_bullet">6.</span> NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS: SUBSCRIBER'S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY: CASTLE does not represent nor warrant that the security equipment and central office monitoring will prevent any loss, damage or injury to person or property, by reason of burglary, theft, hold-up, fire or other cause, or that the security equipment will in all cases provide the protection for which it is installed or intended. Subscriber acknowledges that CASTLE is not an insurer, and the Subscriber assumes all risk for loss or damage to Subscriber's premises or its contents. CASTLE has made no representations or warranties, and hereby disclaims any warranty of merchantability or fitness for any particular use. Subscriber's exclusive remedy for CASTLE's default hereunder is to require CASTLE to repair or replace, at CASTLE's option, any equipment covered by this agreement, which is non-operational.
		</p>
		<p>
      <span class="terms_bullet">7.</span> EXCULPATORY CLAUSE: Subscriber agrees that CASTLE is not an insurer and no insurance coverage is offered herein. The security equipment is designed to reduce certain risks of loss, though CASTLE does not guarantee that no loss will occur. CASTLE is not assuming liability, and, therefore shall not be liable to Subscriber for any loss, personal injury or property damage sustained by Subscriber as a result of burglary, theft, hold-up, fire, equipment failure, smoke, or any other cause, whatsoever, regardless of whether or not such loss or damage was caused by or contributed to by CASTLE’s negligent performance, failure to perform any obligation or strict products liability. Subscriber releases CASTLE from any claims for contribution, indemnity or subrogation.
		</p>
		<p>
      <span class="terms_bullet">8.</span> LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: Subscriber agrees that should there arise any liability on the part of CASTLE as a result of CASTLE’s negligent performance to any degree, failure to perform any of CASTLE’s obligations, equipment failure or strict products liability, that CASTLE’s liability shall be limited to the sum of six times the monthly payment at time liability is fixed or the sum of $250.00, whichever is greater. If Subscriber wishes to increase CASTLE’s maximum amount of CASTLE's limitation of liability, Subscriber may, as a matter of right, at any time, by entering into a supplemental contract, obtain a higher limit by paying an annual payment consonant with CASTLE’s increased liability. This shall not be construed as insurance coverage.
		</p>
		<p>
      <span class="terms_bullet">9.</span> LIQUIDATED DAMAGES: The parties agree that in the event Subscriber suffers damages as a result of CASTLE’s negligence to any degree or failure to perform any obligation, it would be impractical and extremely difficult to anticipate or fix actual damages. Therefore, Subscriber agrees that should there arise any liability on the part of CASTLE, Subscriber agrees to accept $250.00, or the amount provided for in paragraph 8, whichever is greater, as liquidated damages in complete satisfaction of such liability and CASTLE is released and discharged from any further liability.
		</p>
		<p>
      <span class="terms_bullet">10.</span> CARE OF COMMUNICATION SOFTWARE AND TRANSMITTER: Subscriber agrees to bear the cost of repairs or replacement to all equipment made necessary as a result of any damage, including but not limited to damage caused by unauthorized intrusion to the premises, lightning or electrical surge, except for equipment under warranty pursuant to the Sales Contract, in which event repair or replacement to the alarm equipment pursuant to the Sales Contract.
		</p>
		<p>
      <span class="terms_bullet">11.</span> SUBSCRIBER'S DUTY TO SUPPLY ELECTRIC AND COMMUNICATION SERVICE: Subscriber agrees to furnish, at Subscriber's expense, all 110 Volt AC power, electrical outlets, receptacles, telephone hook-ups, RJ31x Block or equivalent, internet connection, high speed broadband cable or DSL and IP Address, as deemed necessary by CASTLE in its sole discretion and to notify CASTLE of any change in such service.
		</p>
		<p>
      <span class="terms_bullet">12.</span> TESTING OF SECURITY SYSTEM: The parties hereto agree that the security equipment, once delivered and installed, is in the exclusive possession and control of the Buyer, and it is Buyer's sole responsibility to install and test the operation of the security equipment and to notify CASTLE if any equipment is in need of repair. Any equipment requiring warranty repair shall be delivered by Buyer to CASTLE and either repaired or replaced within 15 days of receipt. CASTLE provides no repair service at Buyer’s premises. Buyer agrees to test and inspect the security equipment and deliver any inoperable equipment to CASTLE for replacement or repair. In the event Buyer complies with the terms of this agreement and CASTLE fails to repair the security equipment within 15 days of receipt of the inoperable equipment after notice is given Buyer shall not be responsible for payments due while the security equipment remains inoperable. In any lawsuit between the parties in which the condition or operation of the security equipment is in issue, the Buyer shall be precluded from raising the issue that the security equipment was not operating unless the Buyer can establish that the equipment was returned to CASTLE for repair.
		</p>
		<p>
      <span class="terms_bullet">13.</span> LEGAL ACTION: The parties agree that due to the nature of the services to be provided by CASTLE, the payments to be made by the Subscriber for the term of this agreement pursuant to paragraph 3(b) form an integral part of CASTLE's anticipated profits; that in the event of Subscriber's default it would be difficult if not impossible to fix CASTLE's actual damages. Therefore, in the event Subscriber defaults in the payment of any charges to be paid to CASTLE, the balance of all payments for the entire term herein shall immediately become due and payable and Subscriber shall be liable for 80% thereof as liquidated damages, the amount of the monthly charges reflect the equipment selected by the Buyer. The equipment was sold and delivered without charge in consideration of this monitoring agreement. CASTLE shall be permitted to terminate all its services under this agreement and remotely re-program or delete any programming without relieving Subscriber of any obligation herein. In the event CASTLE refers this contract to an attorney Subscriber shall pay CASTLE's legal fees. The parties waive trial by jury in any action between them. In any action commenced by CASTLE against Subscriber, Subscriber shall not be permitted to interpose any counterclaim. Subscriber submits to the jurisdiction of TEXAS and agrees that any litigation between the parties must be commenced and maintained exclusively in the State of TEXAS and in the County where CASTLE’s principal place of business is located. The commencement of any action, proceeding or arbitration and service of legal process or papers in any action, proceeding or arbitration between the parties may be served by prepaid First-Class Mail delivered by the U.S. Post Office or overnight by Federal Express or UPS to the party's address in this agreement or other address provided by a party in writing to other party. Any action by subscriber against CASTLE must be commenced within thirteen months of the accrual of the cause of action or shall be barred. All actions or proceedings against CASTLE must be based on the provisions of this agreement. Any other action that subscriber may have or bring against CASTLE in respect to other services rendered in connection with this agreement shall be deemed to have merged in and be restricted to the terms and conditions of this agreement.

      <span class="terms_bullet">14.</span> DELAY IN INSTALLATION: CASTLE shall not be liable for any damage or loss sustained by Subscriber as a result of delay in installation of equipment, equipment failure, or for interruption of service due to electric failure, strikes, walk-outs, war, acts of God, or other causes, including CASTLE's negligence in the performance of this contract. The estimated date work is to be substantially completed is not a definite completion date and time is not of the essence.
		</p>
		<p>
      <span class="terms_bullet">15.</span> INSURANCE: The Subscriber shall maintain a policy of public liability, property damage, burglary and theft insurance under which CASTLE is named as insured, and under which the insurer agrees to indemnify and hold CASTLE harmless from and against all costs, expenses including attorneys' fees and liability arising out of or based upon any and all claims, injuries and damages arising under this agreement, including, but not limited to, those claims, injuries and damages contributed to by CASTLE's negligent performance to any degree or its failure to perform any obligation. The minimum limits of liability of such insurance shall be one million dollars for any injury or death, and property damage, burglary and theft coverage in an amount necessary to indemnify Subscriber for property on its premises.

CASTLE shall have the right to assign this contract and shall be relieved of any obligations herein upon such assignment.
